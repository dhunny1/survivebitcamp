# survivebitcamp

What?
- We built an e-reader website.

How?
- We used HTML, CSS, JS to build an interactive website that host e-books and lets you read them online. 
- We used turn.js on the book pages, to give the page flib effect for books and make the project a little more cooler.
- We used Google Cloud Storage to host our website and tried to link to the Domain name (survivebitcamp.tech) using Domain.com
- All the PDF were been converted to JPEG files. 

Why?
- We all know how kindle is replacing the books with e-books. We don't have to carry 10 books but with one tablet, we are able to carry much more than 10 books.
- As someone who enjoys books a lot, we wanted to create e-books thats not only online but also gives a special enriching experience with our eye-catching background and turn page effect. 

Future Improvemens?. 
- Ofcourse! This is just a beginning. There is so much more that can be done to this project but due to time constraints (and knowledge), we were only able to make skeleton of the project. 
- One of the possible improvements can be giving page turn effect on PDF formatted files themselves, so we get benefits of PDF but also the cool experience. 


ps: did you notice our color theme are the colors of Bitcamp?
